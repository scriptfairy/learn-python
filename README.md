## Required software

1- Git which can be downloaded for Windows from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
You only need Git if you are planning on committing your project into a Git repo.

2- VScode IDE with [Python externsion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

3- Pytest library which can be installed from the command line on Windows or Mac using pip3 package manager. After installing Pytest, type the following on the command line to make sure it is working:
`
>> pytest -h
`
You might get a warning after installing pytest "WARNING: The scripts py.test.exe and pytest.exe are installed in 'C:\User........"

You will need to add the directory where paytest installed into PATH on Window 10. To do that follow the instructions on [this page](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).
